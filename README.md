**Localight** is a simple SwiftUI chatbot app for iOS 26, powered entirely by Apple‚Äôs on-device Foundation Models. Designed for demonstration purposes, Localight offers fast, private, and completely offline AI chat ‚Äî no internet connection or server required.

Localight showcases how to integrate Apple's local LLM into a native iOS experience using SwiftUI and the new [Foundation Models](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels) framework.
